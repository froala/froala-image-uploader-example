## Steps to run the project

- Download the files in to the project folder in a server enviornment supporting PHP
- Run command `composer install` to install Froala SDK and editor source dependecies.
- Open project in browser to see the results
- Note: In this example we are using https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to enable uploading images from external URL. In production you need to change this to the proxy server you are using. for testing you have to do the following steps:
  - Open the link https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo on a new page
  - Click on "Request temporary access to the demo server" button


The supporting SDK and editor source files are being installed using composer in this example. You can download those directly from https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-php-sdk and https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor into your project folder and update the path to files respectively.
